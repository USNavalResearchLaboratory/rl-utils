A collection of utilities for reinforcement learning.

## Installation
This package is developed for [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.11+. Best practice is to first create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html). The package can be installed locally using `pip install <path>`, where `<path>` is the top-level directory containing `pyproject.toml`. Note that the [editable option](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/local-project-installs/#editable-installs) can be included to track any package modifications. To install optional packages, specify [extras](https://peps.python.org/pep-0508/#extras), as exemplified [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#examples). Developers should install the package with `pip install -e <path>[dev]`. The additional commands below should be run on new environments, activating formatting/linting [hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) and [static typing](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) support:
```
pip install --upgrade pip
pre-commit install
mypy --install-types --non-interactive .
```

The project management tool [hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/) is recommended to simplify local installation. Simply execute `hatch -e dev shell` to create and enter a virtual environment with the package installed in development mode (editable install plus extras). Post-install commands (for `pre-commit`, `mypy`, etc.) are executed automatically.
